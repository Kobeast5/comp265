App Idea

    - The app will be a platform meant for posting visual artwork.
    - Key features include:
        - Uploading image based content
        - Interacting with other users and their content
        - Having a feed of posts catered to the user's interests
        - Searching for specific content

    - For the purpose of this assignment, the app will be for iOS only.


How will the user interact with your app?

    - Users can click on posts, which appear as preview images, to view them fully.
    - Once in this view, users can like, save, comment on the post, and follow the artist.
